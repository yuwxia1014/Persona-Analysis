## Explanations

## Workflow

## Acquire data

## Analyze by describing data
- Which features are categorical?
- Which features are numerical?
- Which features contain blank, null or empty values?
- What is the distribution of numerical feature values across the samples?
- What is the distribution of categorical features in train group?

- Heatmap, correlations among features

## Converting a categorical feature and analyze
- Social Media Followers
- Social Media/ Firework followers

## Drop useless features

## Fill missing value with median value

## Split Train and Test Group (X,Y)
